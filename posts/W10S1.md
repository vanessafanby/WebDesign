# Assignment 1 - Video Edit 
I approached the sonic and visual components using synchronised beat of the music. This includes cuts, transitions, and effects, with the rhythm and tempo of the music. I choose my music from the website 'Artlist io', by the creator Steven Beddall's "Escape Velocity". This music track had a clear and distinct beat, therefore it was easier to sync my video with the rhythm of the music.

This is a short storyboard for what I decided to do for my final video.

As I edited my video footage, I paid lots of attention to the rhythm of the music and made cuts and transitions that align with the beat. As an example, fading out slowly of a scence when the music gradually gets softer, and fast transitioning cuts when the music increasingly gets faster and louder.

At first, I decided on making my video calm and peaceful, with instrumental soundtracks, to allow my audience feel relaxed. Since I had many footage of beautiful sceneries, so I was aiming to keep the video uplifting. However during the editing process, I realised that my first scene takes place in the snow mountains, and is an adventurous scene. Therefore, I changed my idea of making the audience feel excited instead of relaxed in the final video. Here, I've learnt that music can set the atmosphere and mood of a scene, allowing the audience enter the world of my project's world. Furthermore, the final pacing and rhythm of my video shaped a high flow and energy. By manipulating tempo, volume, and intensity, I could controlled the pace of the narrative, build tension, and create dynamic shifts in mood and tone.

In editing my self portrait video, I aimed to encapsulate my personality and interests that are intertwined with sceneries, travelling, and snowboarding. The inclusion of landscapes reflects my admiration for the beauty of the world, and travelling symbolises my favourite hobby and passion. I focused on capturing the essence of each theme while maintaining a cohesive visual narrative. This includes showing the imagery of landscapes, showcasing the beauty of the surrounding environment. I chose vibrant scenes, such as the orange sunset to evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Adding on, to convey the excitness of travel and exploration, I used dynamic compositions and perspectives to capture the excitement of my travelling experiences, inviting the audience to embark on the visual journey with me.

# Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons 
My main idea behind the suite of icons were to open it to the whole community, allowing people get to interact and do acitivities with each other. For example, to post photos or leave comments. The nine icons that I finally settled with were:

**1.** Singing/Karaoke
![description](/static/W10S1/sing.png)

**2.** Painting/Art
![description](/static/W10S1/brush.png)

**3.** Listening to Music (E.g Spotify)

**4.** Piano/Musical Instruments

**9.** Making a post

These are my sketches that represent 'Community'. I experimented with different visual styles, such as flat design and line art. Then, developed more detailed sketches and concepts related to community and interaction.  I then also tried experimenting with different compositions and color schemes to make it more appealing. The final color palette and shading techniques were harmonious, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. I aimed to make each colour combination monochromatic and analogous, creating a soothing and aesthetic effect, but also at the same time makeing the colour combination simple, all from one hue.

I aimed to make my icons harmonious, but also having a contrast with the background. I also simplified complex elements to ensure icons were easily recognisable, ensuring each icon having a consistent visual style. This includes standardising line weights, shapes, and proportions.

I brainstormed a mindmap and sketches from different themes before I started doing the project. I created a chart surrounding the ideas of 'calm' and 'community'.

I decided on making my icons based on the theme 'community' since I just had more thoughts and ideas about the designs. 

By using Illustratorâ€™s basic shape tools, such as squares, circles and lining, I was able to create fundamental elements. Then by using the pen tool, I was able to outline complex shapes and curves, such as the colour palette. Since this was the first time for me to use the pen tool, I found it a little complicated to create some icon shapes. In my first sketch of the profile icon, I was unable to draw the hair, and the shoulders of the figure, using the pen tool. Therefore, I tried to create the icon by using basic shape tools.

These are the icons after transitioning from the original ones. The first design of the icon was acceptable, however I struggled with creating the second design of my icon, resulting it look really confusing and odd. There also wasn't a good transformation of the sound. I didn't do a nice job with sounds since it was realy confusing and didn't bond together nicely with the icons. If I were to make some changes, I would approve on my 2nd transition designs, and record sounds that are dissimiliar. Such as, piano sounds when clicking on the instrument, and flash sounds when clicking on the photograph icon. 

# Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment 
By using a prototype, I was able to get an overall view of my environment, and adjust scales of buildings and trees. This not only made my final environment look more nice, but also helped in detecting areas where optimisation was needed. It also reduced the risk for making changes later in the development process by identifying the problems early.

Reflecting on my Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 works, I found both very enjoyable and fun, however there were some differences. Working in Unity, I learnt and discovered lots of 3D modelling techniques, texturing, and making some sound interactions. Same in Illustrator, I was able to make icon changes and sound interactions, but the final project still needed a big improvement. Designing in 3D environment, I gained a deeper understanding of the spatial relationships and perspective. For example: how objects would appear from different angles and how they would interact within the environment. Furthermore, paying attention to the scale, proportion, and placement of objects to have a more engaging and realistic experience. Whereas working in 2D environment, the spatial relationships were very limited. 

In comparsion with Assignment 3 to Assignment 1, the virtual camera in Unity was important in shaping the audiences view and immersion within the environment. Comparing with the physical camera in video taking, the virtual camera in Unity affected the framing, perspective (first person), and visual focus. These angles created a more interactive and engaging experience, allowing the player to explore the environment by themselves. In contrast, Assignment 1 had different compositions like shot angles. The different types of angles that I used included close-ups, wide shots and medium shots to capture the emotion, setting and environment of the scene.

Comparing to my Assignment 1 and 2 projects, using sounds in Unity enhances the interaction within the environment. The ambient sounds that I used, such as birds chirping, wind rustling through trees, winds, created a more realistic and immersive atmosphere. These sounds that I chose provided context to the environment, making it feel alive. Interactive sounds, like water in the pond and water in hot springs, directly correlated with the player actions and environmental interactions. Whereas in Assignment 1, the background music that I used enhanced the emotional resonance of the content. Making the audience feel passionate and excited. By making the beat and rhythm of the music aligned with video cuts and transitions, it made the visual narrative more engaging. In Illustrator, there were interactions with clicking on the icons, however the audio sounds that I included were similiar, making the overall project confusing.

My virtual environment is set in a quiet village to the snow mountains. I included several contrasting elements such as the change of trees (green to white), the change of scenes (grassland to snowing), and change of ground texture (grass to snow). To achieve this, I ensured that the village had a harmonious design, with wooden cottages and dirt paths blending into the natural landscape. The color palette that I chose are earthy to evoke a sense of peace and coziness. As the player walk through the path, 
the setting starts to transition between the tranquility of village life to the awe in the snow. I added in visual details such as snowdrifts with ambient sounds to position the player into a new environment.

Throughout the process of playtesting in Unity, I discovered several navigation difficulties and interaction problems. Such as moving through paths in the environment, and having problems of walking on bridges (too narrow). At first, my environment was a little too large, therefore I had to shrink the paths by adding more trees and buildings. Additionally, the feedback given from my piers allowed me change unclear paths, sounds and layouts, making my final project more clear, engaging and enjoyable.

# Design thoughts 
For the design of my webpage, I aim to keep it clean and united. Such as, using easy colour palettes, and keeping the design cool and sharp. Furtheremore, I also want to include a menu bar or some clickable icons that can navigate the audience to each content on the website. 
I'm targeting this website to people who like clean and simple graphic designs. With galleries of my projects, I want to let them feel free to browse through my different assignments. The addition of navigation menus, it'll help the audience find the content easier and faster.
