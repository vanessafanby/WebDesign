# Assignment 1 - Video Edit 
I approached the sonic and visual components using synchronised beat of the music. This includes cuts, transitions, and effects, with the rhythm and tempo of the music. I choose my music from the website 'Artlist io', by the creator Steven Beddall's "Escape Velocity". This music track had a clear and distinct beat, therefore it was easier to sync my video with the rhythm of the music.

This is a short storyboard for what I decided to do for my final video.

As I edited my video footage, I paid lots of attention to the rhythm of the music and made cuts and transitions that align with the beat. As an example, fading out slowly of a scence when the music gradually gets softer, and fast transitioning cuts when the music increasingly gets faster and louder.

At first, I decided on making my video calm and peaceful, with instrumental soundtracks, to allow my audience feel relaxed. Since I had many footage of beautiful sceneries, so I was aiming to keep the video uplifting. However during the editing process, I realised that my first scene takes place in the snow mountains, and is an adventurous scene. Therefore, I changed my idea of making the audience feel excited instead of relaxed in the final video. Here, I've learnt that music can set the atmosphere and mood of a scene, allowing the audience enter the world of my project's world. Furthermore, the final pacing and rhythm of my video shaped a high flow and energy. By manipulating tempo, volume, and intensity, I could controlled the pace of the narrative, build tension, and create dynamic shifts in mood and tone.

In editing my self portrait video, I aimed to encapsulate my personality and interests that are intertwined with sceneries, travelling, and snowboarding. The inclusion of landscapes reflects my admiration for the beauty of the world, and travelling symbolises my favourite hobby and passion. I focused on capturing the essence of each theme while maintaining a cohesive visual narrative. This includes showing the imagery of landscapes, showcasing the beauty of the surrounding environment. I chose vibrant scenes, such as the orange sunset to evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Adding on, to convey the excitness of travel and exploration, I used dynamic compositions and perspectives to capture the excitement of my travelling experiences, inviting the audience to embark on the visual journey with me.

# Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons 
How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?
My main idea behind the suite of icons were to open it to the whole community, allowing people get to interact and do acitivities with each other. For example, to post photos or leave comments. The nine icons that I finally settled with were:

**1.** Singing/Karaoke

**2.** Painting/Art

**3.** Listening to Music (E.g Spotify)

• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
I brainstormed different ideas and sketches from different themes before I started doing the project. I created a chart surrounding the ideas of 'calm' and 'community'.

• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?

• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?
The first design of the icon was acceptable, however I struggled with creating the second design of my icon, resulting in a confusing icon. 

# Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment 
How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?
• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?
• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?
• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?
