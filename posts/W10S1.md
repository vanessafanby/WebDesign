# Assignment 1 - Video Edit 
I approached the sonic and visual components using synchronised beat of the music. This includes cuts, transitions, and effects, with the rhythm and tempo of the music. I choose my music from the website 'Artlist io', by the creator Steven Beddall's "Escape Velocity". This music track had a clear and distinct beat, therefore it was easier to sync my video with the rhythm of the music.

This is a short storyboard for what I decided to do for my final video.

As I edited my video footage, I paid lots of attention to the rhythm of the music and made cuts and transitions that align with the beat. As an example, fading out slowly of a scence when the music gradually gets softer, and fast transitioning cuts when the music increasingly gets faster and louder.

At first, I decided on making my video calm and peaceful, with instrumental soundtracks, to allow my audience feel relaxed. Since I had many footage of beautiful sceneries, so I was aiming to keep the video uplifting. However during the editing process, I realised that my first scene takes place in the snow mountains, and is an adventurous scene. Therefore, I changed my idea of making the audience feel excited instead of relaxed in the final video. Here, I've learnt that music can set the atmosphere and mood of a scene, allowing the audience enter the world of my project's world. Furthermore, the final pacing and rhythm of my video shaped a high flow and energy. By manipulating tempo, volume, and intensity, I could controlled the pace of the narrative, build tension, and create dynamic shifts in mood and tone.

In editing my self portrait video, I aimed to encapsulate my personality and interests that are intertwined with sceneries, travelling, and snowboarding. The inclusion of landscapes reflects my admiration for the beauty of the world, and travelling symbolises my favourite hobby and passion. I focused on capturing the essence of each theme while maintaining a cohesive visual narrative. This includes showing the imagery of landscapes, showcasing the beauty of the surrounding environment. I chose vibrant scenes, such as the orange sunset to evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Adding on, to convey the excitness of travel and exploration, I used dynamic compositions and perspectives to capture the excitement of my travelling experiences, inviting the audience to embark on the visual journey with me.

# Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons 
How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?
My main idea behind the suite of icons were to open it to the whole community, allowing people get to interact and do acitivities with each other. For example, to post photos or leave comments. The nine icons that I finally settled with were:

**1.** Singing/Karaoke

**2.** Painting/Art

**3.** Listening to Music (E.g Spotify)

**4.** Piano/Musical Instruments

**8.** Profile Picture

**9.** Making a post

These are my sketches that represent 'Community'. I experimented with different visual styles, such as flat design and line art. Then, developed more detailed sketches and concepts related to community and interaction.  I then also tried experimenting with different compositions and color schemes to make it more appealing. The final color palette and shading techniques were harmonious, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. I aimed to make each colour combination monochromatic and analogous, creating a soothing and aesthetic effect, but also at the same time makeing the colour combination simple, all from one hue.

I aimed to make my icons harmonious, but also having a contrast with the background. I also simplified complex elements to ensure icons were easily recognisable, ensuring each icon having a consistent visual style. This includes standardising line weights, shapes, and proportions.

I brainstormed a mindmap and sketches from different themes before I started doing the project. I created a chart surrounding the ideas of 'calm' and 'community'.

I decided on making my icons based on the theme 'community' since I just had more thoughts and ideas about the designs. 

By using Illustrator’s basic shape tools, such as squares, circles and lining, I was able to create fundamental elements. Then by using the pen tool, I was able to outline complex shapes and curves, such as the colour palette. Since this was the first time for me to use the pen tool, I found it a little complicated to create some icon shapes. In my first sketch of the profile icon, I was unable to draw the hair, and the shoulders of the figure, using the pen tool. Therefore, I tried to create the icon by using basic shape tools.

These are the icons after transitioning from the original ones. The first design of the icon was acceptable, however I struggled with creating the second design of my icon, resulting it look really confusing and odd. There also wasn't a good transformation of the sound. I didn't do a nice job with sounds since it was realy confusing and didn't bond together nicely with the icons. If I were to make some changes, I would approve on my 2nd transition designs, and record sounds that are dissimiliar. Such as, piano sounds when clicking on the instrument, and flash sounds when clicking on the photograph icon. 

I recorded nine sounds using the 'recording' app on the phone and uploaded them on Adobe Audition. First of all, I chose the snippet that I wanted to use as my soundtrack. Secondly, I cropped off the excess sounds and adjusted the fade in fade out levels. Finally, I went to 'Effects', 'Amplitude and Compression', and 'Normalised' the process to 100 percent. Moved the 9 sounds to the 'Batch Process' and clicked 'run' to save it in my folder. 

# Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment 
How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?
• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?
• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?
• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?
• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?


 What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
