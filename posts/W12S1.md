Does this webpage feel unique and individual to the person who created it? What does it say about them as an artist or designer, and how could this be further articulated?
Do the various individual content elements feel unified? What could be done to make them feel more unified, if necessary?
Can you get a good sense of their design process through this timeline? Would any additional process documentation or written reflection be beneficial in illustrating this?
