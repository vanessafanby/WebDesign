Then, downloaded backgrounds that I thought suited the theme of my webpage.

I decided to use the scenery of aurora as my Introduction page, followed by a black scene for my Assignment 1 reflection with images.

Since I included aurora as my first image, I decided to use other different sceneries as my background. Such as mountains, snow, trees or waves. I've tried to keep the colours black and 'night' themed, since it looks really awkwards if its suddenly a night scene transitioning to white.

At the moment, this is my idea for the webpage's layout.

I then added images and my reflection statement on the webpage.

For this webpage, I used several supporting images that reflect on my Semester One's work. These are the Assignments...

On the right, I pressed on 'Prototype' to click and drag points from one connection points to another page in the Frame, making the user to find the page they want to see faster and easier.

Too add on, I also added the 'home' button on each reflective assignment page. This is to make it more easier to navigate through the webape
