During class, we did an activity where we generated wireframes from a webpage. Here, I have chose to do the 'Gmail' webpage, just because I'm familiar with that. 

**This is the Origianl Screenshot of Webpage**

This is the wireframe that I did for 'Google' before looking at the design.

**Adding other details after looking at the design**
This is the wireframe that I did for 'Google' after looking at the design. The overall look is quite similiar, just needed to add some icons.

**Design 3**

These are the three design templates that I thought of doing for my webpage. Since I'm aiming to make my webpage clean and aesthetic, so I'm going to use Design 3. Now, I'm going to expand my thoughts and ideas using this template. 

I also quite like Design 1 and 2, however it looks a little odd. I will have to experiment all these template on Figma to see which one suits more. 

# More Ideas

These are the 6 new designs I made. 
I figured out that its best to keep the webpage easy and simple, since I'll need to stick with the theme of 'clean', 'tidy', and 'aesthetic'. 
I might start adding all these designs on the Figma Webpage, with texts and photos to see the overall results.
