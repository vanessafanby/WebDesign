To make them intersect with each other, I selected both shapes and clicked on the 'Boolean Groups' button that appeared at the top of the screen. Then, selecedt the boolean type that I wanted.

**5**
To make the fill in the shape look gradient, I clicked on the 'Fill' section where I could adjust the colour of my rectangle. And by clicking on the square next to the hexadecimal code,I am able to choose from a variety of options. Such as solid and
Radial. I pressed on the linear setting, and choose the 'gradient'option for my background colour.

To add a heading, I used the 'text tool' to implement and layout my text elements. In the 'fill' section, I was able to changed the texts weight and size.
