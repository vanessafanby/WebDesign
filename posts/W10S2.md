# Written Draft

**Artist Statement Assignment 1 - Video Edit**

In my self-portrait video, I showcased my passion for snowboarding and exploration to the audience. By opening the scene with my hobby, I inviting the audience to share the journey with me. During the video, the audience are able to gaze the beautiful scenery in the mountains and landscapes, allowing them to embark on a visual journey alongside me, immersing them in the travelling and fun in snowboarding. Through editing and creative storytelling, I aim to make my self-portrait video engaging through my passion in adventure and discovery.



**Artist Statement Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**

In my Graphic icons project, I created 9 interactive icons where individuals can engage in activities like photo sharing, commenting, and collaborative drawing. These interactive icons allows users to play, connect, and collaborate with other users in the community. 



**Artist Statement Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**

By walking in my environment, I wanted the audience to feeel a sense of calmness and peacefulness. By transitioning from greenery to snowscapes, I've designed the setting to harmonise with nature, with wooden cottages and dirt paths integrating into the landscape. By using a earthy and natural color palette, I aim to convery feelings of relaxation when players navigate in the game. As they travel through the pathways, they embark on a visual and auditory journey, transitioning from the tranquility of village life to the amusing beauty in the snow mountains. Snowdrifts and ambient sounds transport players into this new environment, immersing them in its wonder.

# Images and Interactions
I created a new folder on my laptop and put in the images that I wanted to include in my webpage.

**Biography**

In all three assignments, two of them are set in the snow. This is because I love travelling and like to immerse myself in those settings and sceneries.
